## Date Pickers

Date Pickers allow users to select a single date or date range.

## Design

[Material Design: Pickers](https://material.io/design/components/pickers.html)

## Demo

Date Pickers are under active development. You can see the current version of
the
[Material Picker Demo](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/catalog/java/io/material/catalog/datepicker/DatePickerMainDemoFragment.java)
in the Material Android Catalog. The demo launches and listens to material
pickers with customization options for dialog and fullscreen.

## Code

The
[Picker Package](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/datepicker)
contains most of the code for this component, with the main entry point being
[MaterialDatePicker](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/datepicker/MaterialDatePicker.java).

## Time Pickers

Time Pickers are currently not under development.
